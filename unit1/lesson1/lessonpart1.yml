  ### What are Strings in Python?


  In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single
  quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are one of the most commonly used
  data types in Python and are used to represent text.


  #### Examples of Strings:

  ```python

  # Single-quoted string

  name = 'Alice'


  # Double-quoted string

  greeting = "Hello, world!"


  # Multi-line string using triple quotes

  message = """This is a 

  multi-line string."""

  ```


  ### String Operations


  Python provides many ways to manipulate and work with strings. Here are some
  common operations:


  #### Concatenation

  You can combine strings using the `+` operator:

  ```python

  first_name = "John"

  last_name = "Doe"

  full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

  print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe

  ```


  #### Repetition

  You can repeat a string using the `*` operator:

  ```python

  word = "Hi! "

  repeated_word = word * 3

  print(repeated_word)  # Output: Hi! Hi! Hi! 

  ```


  #### Accessing Characters

  Strings are indexed, meaning you can access individual characters using their
  position (starting at 0):

  ```python

  text = "Python"

  print(text[0])  # Output: P

  print(text[-1])  # Output: n (last character)

  ```


  #### Slicing

  You can extract a portion of a string using slicing:

  ```python

  text = "Python"

  print(text[0:3])  # Output: Pyt

  print(text[2:])   # Output: thon

  ```


  ### Common String Methods


  Python strings come with built-in methods to perform various tasks. Here are a
  few examples:


  - `lower()`: Converts the string to lowercase.

  - `upper()`: Converts the string to uppercase.

  - `strip()`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace.

  - `replace()`: Replaces a substring with another substring.

  - `split()`: Splits the string into a list based on a delimiter.


  #### Example:

  ```python

  sentence = "  Hello, Python!  "

  print(sentence.lower())  # Output: hello, python!

  print(sentence.strip())  # Output: Hello, Python!

  print(sentence.replace("Python", "World"))  # Output: Hello, World!

  ```


  ### Practice Task


  Write a Python program that:

  1. Takes a user's name as input.

  2. Greets the user with a message like "Hello, [name]!".

  3. Converts the name to uppercase and prints it.
